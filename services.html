        <h1>Services that we can help you with</h1>
        <p>
          First of all, you have to realise that we're a small family run business and 
          we're proud of that, our main line of business has been and will likely always be 
          <b>Scrap Metal Collection</b>. But over the years, our customers have come to know 
          us, they know we're flexible, we're willing to have a go and we're pretty determined.
          <br><br>So below you will find the services that we do most often, but we're not <b>Stuck in a box</b>
          like the big companies, if you need something that you don't see below, just 
          <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> with some more information and if we can do it, 
          then we can provide an estimate and start from there. If we can't help you, then there
          is still a good chance that we know another great local business that can help you. 
          Either way, you have nothing to lose. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="services">
        <div class="service">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="images/001.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h2>Commercial Scrap Collection</h2>
          <br>This is what we, and most others, call a <b>Business to Business (B2B)</b> service, 
          which is fancy for saying we can provide all the paperwork that businesses need 
          when contracting out part or all of a job to another business.
        </div>
        <div class="service">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="images/002.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h2>Domestic Scrap Collection</h2>
          <br>This is a fancy way of saying we don't just work with businesses, in fact, 
          a significant percentage of our business comes from working with domestic customers.
          We can collect any scrap metal whatever the requirement and offer 
          you the <b>best market prices</b>.
        </div>
        <div class="service">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="images/003.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h2>Buying Old Vehicles</h2>
          <br>We buy any vehicle in any condition, MOT failures, accident damaged, 
          write offs as well as good, working vehicles. <br><br>
          We're not a broker or middleman, you deal direct with us, <b>no hidden fees!</b>
        </div>
        <div class="service">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="images/004.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h2>Vehicle Recovery</h2>
          <br>Because w2e have all of these big trucks, we're actually pretty well 
          equipped for <b>Vehicle Recovery</b> as well. Again, this is something 
          we can offer to both <b>Commercial</b> and <b>Domestic</b> customers alike.
        </div>
        <div class="service">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="images/005.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h2>Buying Valuable Metals</h2>
          <br>You've seen the adverts on TV, not from us, but they are basically doing the 
          same thing. If you have unwanted precious metals, then why not contact us for the 
          <b>best price</b>, we're just as competetive as the big boys, but we're keeping the 
          business local, so why not give us a try first.
        </div>
        <div class="service">
          <div class="icon">
            <img src="images/006.png" alt="" />
          </div>
          <h2>Tree Dropping</h2>
          <br>This is a great example of us offering more services than some of our competition
          We started offering this service because a long-time customer asked us to. And you know what,
          well, <b>we're pretty good at it</b>. Before we knew it, other customers (old and new) were asking
          for this service.
